# üßê About GITS3.2

"Your repo is your resume. But what is a good looking repo?"

So you want to start a Project on Github <br><br>
Do CLI commands scare you?? <br><br>
Do platform dependencies of softwares available annoy you?? <br><br>
Don't worry we got you! Introducing GITS3.2

GITS3.2 simplifies the organization of your repository according to Software Engineering Standards, ensuring it adheres to the required structure for a "Well-Structured Repository."

Think of GITS3.2 as a foundational repository that helps align your project repository with these standards.

Here are few motivation points to come up with this idea

1. When dealing with various files and branches, there often arises a need to update multiple commands in a particular sequence, which can become cumbersome. Employing a custom command that can execute multiple commands simultaneously in a predefined order is a time-saving and developer-friendly solution.
2. While tackling an assignment for the course, we discovered a shortage of project repositories that follow a standardized structure.
3. Developers might struggle to create projects that are easily transferable.

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation Setup

1. Install the pre-requisites Python 3.9 or above from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Open terminal and clone repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/psvkaushik/Group50_Proj2
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory and enter following command on terminal for linux or mac os
   ```
   bash setup.sh
   ```
   Navigate to the directory and enter following command on terminal for windows
   ```
   windows_setup
   ```

Detail about generating token is given [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)

4. Navigate to the project directory and run the app.py file as follows
   ```bash
   python3 ./src/app.py
   ```

# üó∫Ô∏èRoadmap

- [x] Initally , the software had separate implementaion for Linux, Windows or MAC . Now we have made sure the commands can be executed on all platforms without any dependancies
- [x] Also made an executable to setup the project on command line for ease of use for the user
- [x] Implemented a UI
- [x] Provided feature to add custom commands and included instaructions on using template to create corressponding code
- [x] GitHub token management
- [x] Website without refresh
- [x] Host application on cloud
