# Troubleshooting tips:

Following are few tips we learnt as worked through this project:

1. If you run the setup.sh or windows_setup.bat file, it gives you an environment which is ready with requirements installed for the application to run.
   However, before running the script, you need to make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed in your system orelse the script might throw some error
2. Currently the web server we implemented, after executing one command it does not go back to the home page. You need to refresh the webpage, so make sure you do that
3. [Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) of your account should be set as your environment variable in your system, orelse the commands won't work as token provides authorization to work on your repo
4. Make sure you have proper internet connection
