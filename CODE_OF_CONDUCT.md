# Our Community Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

In our ongoing effort to maintain an open and inclusive community, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to ensure a respectful and harassment-free environment for all, regardless of age, physical appearance, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, education, socio-economic background, nationality, personal presentation, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Guidelines

We aim to foster a positive atmosphere by encouraging:

- The use of welcoming and inclusive language
- Respect for diverse perspectives and experiences
- Thoughtful acceptance of constructive feedback
- Prioritization of community well-being
- Demonstrating empathy towards fellow community members

Unacceptable behavior by participants may include:

- Employing sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual advances
- Engaging in trolling, issuing derogatory comments, and making personal or political attacks
- Perpetrating public or private harassment
- Sharing others' private information, physical or electronic, without explicit consent
- Demonstrating behavior that could be deemed inappropriate in a professional context

## Our Duties

Project maintainers bear the responsibility of defining and clarifying acceptable behavior standards. They are expected to take appropriate and equitable corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable conduct.

Project maintainers have the authority and duty to modify or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They may also issue temporary or permanent bans on contributors for other behavior that they perceive as inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and public spaces when an individual represents the project or community. Representation may involve using an official project email address, posting through an official social media account, or serving as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Project maintainers can further clarify this representation.

## Enforcement

If you witness abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project team at [contact_email]. All complaints will be thoughtfully reviewed and investigated. The response will be deemed necessary and suitable to the circumstances. The project team is obliged to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter's identity. Detailed enforcement policies may be provided separately.

Project maintainers who do not adhere to or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
